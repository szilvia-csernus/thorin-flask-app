          <p class="post-meta">Thorin and Company were a group of thirteen 
            Dwarves, the Wizard Gandalf, and the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, 
            led by Thorin II Oakenshield in TA 2941. Their purpose was to 
            regain the lost Dwarven kingdom of the Lonely Mountain from the 
            dragon Smaug.</p>
          <p class="post-meta">
            The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
            recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug came
            and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to
            add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed that
            someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves
            also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a
            fourteenth to fill into their party.
